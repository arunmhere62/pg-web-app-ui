                  <p><strong>1. Role:</strong> Any registered User of IndianPGManagement.com Cloud may choose to make license payments, feature payments, rent payments, maintenance payments, payment of security deposit/ token amounts and booking amounts through the payment gateway(s) authorized by IndianPGManagement.com. In this regard, the Users are asked to provide customary billing information such as name, mobile number, financial instrument information which shall include the bank account number, IFSC code of the User, the details of the landlord to whom the payment has to be made and the address of the property with regard to which the rent or security deposit is to be paid. Users may also be asked to provide a copy of the rental agreement pursuant to which such rent payments are being made. The Users must provide accurate, current, and complete information while making the payment through the Site and it shall be the User's obligation to keep this information up-to-date at all times. The Users are solely responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the information provided by them and IndianPGManagement.com shall not be responsible for any loss suffered by the User as a result of any incorrect information, including payment information provided by the Users.</p>
                  <p>Except for IndianPGManagement.com's limited role in processing the payments that registered Users authorize or initiate, IndianPGManagement.com is not involved in any underlying transaction between the User, any other User, any third person or any service providers. IndianPGManagement.com is not a bank and does not offer any banking or related services. IndianPGManagement.com may use the services of one or more third parties (each a "Processor") to provide the Service and process the User's transactions. Further, IndianPGManagement.com does not guarantee payment on behalf of any registered User, other User or Processor and explicitly disclaims all liability for any act or omission of any User or Processor. IndianPGManagement.com is neither an agent of the lessor or lessee or any registered User. IndianPGManagement.com acts solely as an intermediary which facilitates payments between the registered Users making the payment and the intended third-party beneficiaries.</p>
                  <p><strong>2. Authorization:</strong> The User acknowledges that IndianPGManagement.com is authorized by the User to hold, receive and disburse funds in accordance with the User's payment instructions provided through the Site for the purposes of facilitating the transfer of monies to the intended beneficiary as specified by the User on the Site. [The authorization given by the Users permits IndianPGManagement.com Cloud (a) to debit or credit the User's balance, bank account, any credit card, debit card, or other payment cards or any other payment method that IndianPGManagement.com accepts] or (b) to process payment transactions that the Users authorize by generating an electronic funds transfer. [By instructing IndianPGManagement.com to pay another User, the Users authorize and order IndianPGManagement.com to make the payments (less any applicable fees or other amounts we may collect under this Agreement) to such user. IndianPGManagement.com may limit the recipient's ability to use or withdraw the committed funds for such period of time that IndianPGManagement.com has agreed to with the recipient.]</p>
                  <p><strong>3. Fees:</strong> The User agrees that they may be charged a service charge by IndianPGManagement.com for using the Site to make rental payments, payment of security deposits, maintenance payments and booking payments.</p>
                  <p><strong>4. Transaction Limits:</strong> IndianPGManagement.com may delay, suspend or reject a transaction for any payment(s) for any reason, including without limitation if IndianPGManagement.com suspects that the transaction subjects it to financial or security risk or is unauthorized, fraudulent, suspicious, unlawful, in violation of the terms of this Agreement subject to dispute or otherwise unusual.</p>
                  <p><strong>5. Chargebacks:</strong> The amount of a transaction may be charged back or reversed to the User (a "Chargeback") if the transaction (a) is disputed by the sender, (b) is reversed for any reason, (c) was not authorized or IndianPGManagement.com has reason to believe that the transaction was not authorized, or (d) is allegedly unlawful, suspicious, or in violation of the terms of this Agreement. The Users owe IndianPGManagement.com and will immediately pay IndianPGManagement.com the amount of any Chargeback and any associated fees, fines, or penalties assessed by IndianPGManagement.com's Processor, processing financial institutions, or MasterCard, Visa, American Express, Discover, and other payment card networks, associations, or companies ("Networks"). The Users agree to assist IndianPGManagement.com when requested, at the User's expense, to investigate any of the User's transactions processed through the Service. For Chargebacks associated with cards, IndianPGManagement.com will work with the Users to contest the Chargeback with the Network or issuing banks should the User choose to contest the Chargeback. In this regard, IndianPGManagement.com will request necessary information from the User to contest the Chargeback and the User's failure to timely assist IndianPGManagement.com in investigating a transaction, including without limitation providing necessary documentation within 5 business days of IndianPGManagement.com's request, may result in an irreversible Chargeback.</p>
                  <p><strong>6. Liability:</strong> The Users agree not to hold IndianPGManagement.com responsible and/or liable for any issue or claim arising out of any dispute whatsoever between the User and the Processor and/or the User and the User's bank or financial institution.</p>
                  <p>Additionally, please note that IndianPGManagement.com shall not be responsible for any additional fees or charges deducted by the Processors while processing payments in connection with the User's transaction and IndianPGManagement.com disclaims all liability in this regard. Further, the Users may also be subject to additional terms and conditions imposed by such Processors and the Users should review these terms and conditions before authorizing any payments through the Processors.</p>
                  <p><strong>7. Refund and Cancellation:</strong> License and Feature payments are non-refundable in any case. In case, IndianPGManagement.com is not able to facilitate the payments to the beneficiary account due to any technical difficulties.</p>
                  <p><strong>8.</strong> The Users acknowledge and agree that, to the maximum extent permitted by law, the entire risk arising out of the User's access to and use of the payment Services remains with the Users. If the Users permit or authorize another person to use their IndianPGManagement.com account in any way, the Users shall be responsible for the actions taken by that person. Neither IndianPGManagement.com nor any other party or Processor involved in creating, producing, or delivering the payment Services will be liable for any incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages, including lost profits, loss of data or loss of goodwill, service interruption, computer damage or system failure or the cost of substitute products or services, or for any damages for personal or bodily injury or emotional distress arising out of or in connection with these payments terms.</p>
